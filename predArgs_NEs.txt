The Avalanche doubled-up Phoenix in shots 16-8 - and these weren't the usual benign Avalanche hailmarys from the boards and bad angles. The Avs created multiple opportunities in and around the crease, on the fly or with some strong cycling, but Mike Smith stood tall.

#line: With exactly 6 minutes left in the first, Cody McLeod lined up to take a face off and apparently was offended by the concept and abruptly dropped gloves with Kyle Chipchura . McLeod won the fight and then skated by his bench and politely shared some of his pep with his comrades. Bordeleau tried to engage in some fist-a-cuffs off the same face off, but McLeod, wait for it,....... beat him to the punch.

This is really only worth mentioning because whatever happened on the play Phoenix lost Steve Sullivan to a Game Misconduct, apparently he needed his mouth washed out with soap. Too bad for Phoenix as the Avs handed them a long 5-on--3 and Sullivan was brought in this past offseason to beef up their PP. The Avs got some help from the post, but were able to get out of the second unscathed and nursing their 2-1 lead into the third.

#line: Some scary moments early in the third when Eric Johnson took a hit up high on his head/jaw from the giant Martin Hanzal . From the replay camera angle it looked like a solid hockey hit and Johnson was just caught turning into the blindsiding behemoth, but it sure looked like Johnson's head was the initial point of contact. Johnson stayed on the ice, but at the whistle skated straight to the bench and started beating the crap out of inanimate objects on his way to the locker room. He did not return. The news only got worse when a little later Antoine Vermette plowed through the slot and collided hard with Matt Duchene. Dutchy went off, later returned, but was obviously stinging.

While Humpty Dumpty was being put back together, an up and down broken play went from bad to rad as Duchene sprung out on a breakaway and beat Smith with a great fake to get the Phoenix goaltender moving and then slid the puck underneath him to put the Avs up 2-1. The Avs' focused attack in the first carried over into the second and just 4 mins in the Avs turned the tide. Nice.

#line: The Avalanche came out with all kinds of jump, taking the play at Phoenix relentlessly for the first 5 minutes of the game, but an unlucky call against Sgarbossa for cross-checking (Vermette caught an edge making Sgarbossa's light little back pat look like a savage stampede of hate and evil) halted the Avs' forward momentum putting them down a man early. But the NHL's best home Penalty-Kill (yes, you read that right) killed off the penalty. In fact, the Coyotes didn't get their first shot on goal until after their power play, about 7 and 1/2 minutes in. But just as the Altidudes commented on how Phoenix had been shut out for almost 4 straight periods, Shane Doan snuck a quick back hander off a wrap around past Varlamov to put the visitors up 1-0. Not a good goal. Maybe it hit a skate or something? I hope....

#line: The Avalanche created a flurry in front of Smith with about 3 minutes left as the puck seemed to do everything but go in the back of the net. Yet another Avalanche player was hurt during the chaos as McLeod absorbed a gutless cross check in the side of his unprotected ribs. The Avs got a couple powerplays to end regulation that carried over to the Avs' first post-regulation game of the 2013 season. The overtime PP created a 4-on-3 advantage, but Mike Smith was able to fend off the onslaught, and then a stupid bounce off the refs skate turned what was a harmless puck over to Phoenix with numbers deep inside the Avs zone and Shane Doan netted the game winner. Unlucky bounce, but the Avs get a loser point. Unfortunate finish as the Avs outplayed Phoenix tonight. Hopefully the injuries sustained will turn out to be minor and we don't have to explore the organization's "depth" any more than we already are.

In 2008-09, he scored just 12 goals and was promptly traded to Ottawa, where he only scored five times in 2009-10 before the Senators bought out his contract.

#line: Those who imply otherwise don’t know the whole story, according to Maguranis. The media was quick to report that a coyote bit a little boy in Massachusetts about 13 years ago, Maguranis said, but no one reported the rest of the story: After hitting what was likely the same coyote with his car, a veterinarian had taken it in and fed it for 16 weeks before releasing it into the wild.

#line: Coyotes don’t eat large animals, added Maguranis, who goes through coyote droppings (or "scat") almost daily and finds short hair from the rabbits, voles, mice and other small rodents it hunts – sometimes with the aid of a form of echolocation involving the rodents’ tunnels under the snow, Maguranis said.

#line: Kill a pair of coyotes, and three more pairs typically take over their territory. Kill a member of a pack and the alpha female begins having litters larger than the average five pups, reacting to the threat of extermination. Kill the alpha female and the other females in the pack, previously not allowed to breed, begin having pups.

#line: The Spurs and Thunder have spent most of the season trading first, with the Los Angeles Clippers and Miami Heat interjecting briefly. With the Spurs' continued excellence despite injuries to Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili and the Thunder's general dominance, it's tough to chose. The teams even split their first two games against each other.

#line: Defense has become a bit of a dirty word for the Houston Rockets. They've given up 100-plus points in six of their last eight games. The Rockets have been playing better, but unless they get the defense figured out, they're not going anywhere in the postseason.

For as many seeds of doubt as the Billikens planted (at least in my brain; your synaptic mileage may vary) in the first two weeks of A-10 play, after five consecutive victories it would appear that things are coming along just fine in Arch-land. (Ha, no one calls Saint Louis that.) After a home overtime loss to Rhode Island on Jan. 19, Jim Crews' squad demolished Butler and Dayton at home and handled business in three potentially tricky road games against RPI landmines. The most important trend? Defense. Saint Louis struggled in this regard for weeks, but it has since established itself as the stingiest per-possession defense in the Atlantic 10, and that should help the Billikens avoid setbacks on the road as they seek to bolster that NCAA tournament resume.

#line: 13. St. Bonaventure. I've gone back and forth on the Bonnies here and there, particularly after they notched consecutive wins at Temple and Saint Joe's, but the deeper we get into the season the clearer it becomes that these defensive woes (1.13 PPP allowed) aren't going anywhere.

#line: 5. Temple. It's genuinely hard to know what to make of Temple's latest win, an 89-88 home victory over Charlotte. Why? Because Charlotte, the 15th-best offense in the Atlantic 10, should never score 88 points on anyone, anywhere -- home, away, on Mars, anywhere. I know, I know: Temple got out of there with the W, which is what really matters. But 88 points in 74 possessions? Really? To Charlotte? Just another data point in a baffling Owls season, I guess.

Without (god forbid) going into the whole eight-way tie thing again -- and again, you should not be freaking out about these ranks at this point -- this is where the validity of ranking any one A-10 outfit over the other starts to go a bit sideways. I like Xavier, and Chris Mack has done some nice things with a young team, particularly on the glass; the Musketeers out-board the rest of the league on both the offensive and defensive ends.

#line: Meanwhile, in the East, the Knicks don't want to see the Bulls. The Heat are often so focused on the Celtics as rivals that they miss the fact that Indiana has significant matchup advantages and had a very good chance to eliminate them last year, Bosh or no Bosh. No team wants to see the Heat, but the Nets get absolutely destroyed by Miami's specific set of talent.

#line: The times they are changing, and the NBA’s Eastern Conference is turning over and changing with the times. Teams from the bottom half have moved solidly into the top three, and although they continue to win, the Miami Heat do not have the cushion they had in the first half of the season. There seem to be more than just one or two teams emerging that could give the Heat a run season, so let's look at the updated East standings and see if I have the teams similarly ranked.

Williams is averaging 16.7 points, 7.6 assists and 3.3 rebounds this season. C.J. Watson started at point guard against the Pacers. ... Pacers small forward Danny Granger (left knee) went through his first full-court contact practice Sunday. Coach Frank Vogel said Granger responded well after the practice. "He said he felt really good," Vogel said. "Couple of movements he felt like he was still getting his confidence back to explode. No pain or anything. Just normal recovering type of stuff in your first live action." Granger will make his season debut against Charlotte on Wednesday or the Pacers will hold him out until after the All-Star break so that he can make his debut against the New York Knicks on Feb. 20. ... West left the game in the first quarter after Lopez inadvertently scratched him in the left eye.

#line: The Heat had an up-and-down last week, but they still sit atop the East with a 1 1/2 game cushion. Over the last week, the Heat have played in two overtime games, winning one and losing the other. Last night they had a huge win against the Brooklyn Nets, which most of us saw coming after the ignorant comments of Reggie Evans. However, even though they continue to win their lead in the Eastern conference is shrinking fast. With the exception of a trip to Indiana they don't have that many tough games within the next week, however right before and right after the All-Star break Miami has a stretch of about six very tough games in a row. They could be fade material coming soon.

#line: Despite their ugly loss last night to Miami, the Nets hold down the fourth spot on my power rankings once again this week. Brooklyn has been playing very well since Avery Johnson fired, and I do not know if there is correlation in that or if it is just coincidence, but the fact remains that Brooklyn has finally emerged as one of the East’s best teams. Deron Williams is finally starting to look like himself once again, and that always leads to getting easier shots for the rest of Brooklyn's starters. They need to prove (much like the Knicks, Bulls and Heat have done already this season) that they can beat the NBA's best teams. If and/or when they do it, watch out and be ready with your NBA betting tickets.

#line: The Knicks went 3-1 SU since my last power rankings update, however they are sticking in the third spot for now. My main reasoning for this is that I think the Knicks have referred back to some of their old ways. They fall in love with the three-point shot even when it's not falling, and in some games their defense has been severely lacking. Carmelo Anthony is only one man, and if New York's three-point arsenal isn't on, that puts a ton of pressure on him. The Knicks and Bulls could very well be interchangeable in the two and three spots on my power rankings, but New York’s recent lack of defensive intensity is somewhat concerning. I think the Knicks might be fade material right now in certain cases.

#line: Chicago ascended to the two spot in my power rankings last week, and it is looking more and more like they are in fact the second best team in the Eastern conference. The emergence of Jimmy Butler for this team has been like making a big trade without having to give anything up. Not to mention the fact that Derrick Rose just started taking full contact in practice. Even though Rose's return will be slow and likely off the bench, 20 minutes of Derrick Rose is still better than three out of every four NBA players. The Bulls have two, and arguably three All-Stars this year, and once all the pieces of the puzzle are in place, and if Rose is healthy towards the end of the regular season, watch out Lebron. I think Chicago might start evening out that awful ATS record of theirs soon and begin to beat the NBA odds . They started last night.

Chicago currently hold the overall no 11 spot (out of 30 teams) with 20 wins and 20 losses. As Stein points out, "It's getting harder and harder to resist projecting what the Bulls will look like when Derrick Rose comes back. One big reason for that: Chicago already has the best intraconference record in the East at a tidy 23-9. Which goes rather nicely with the East's best road record (15-9)."

#line: 6. Massachusetts. I suppose you could say I'm coming around on UMass. Or you could say I'm very rapidly transitioning from my role as someone who allows tempo-free statistics to aid much of my fickle eyeballs' analysis into someone who must acknowledge the cold realpolitik of NCAA tournament qualification. (It is kind of what I do around here .) Either way, the fact of the matter is that for as utterly mediocre as UMass' per-possessions numbers tell me the Minutemen are, and for as rarely as I've been impressed when I've watched them this season, their at-large profile is such that they have a pretty good chance of getting into the NCAA tournament. It's pretty strange: This is a team that isn't truly bad at anything (save 3-point shooting) but excels at nothing (save perhaps field-goal defense, and UMass has gotten more more and more stops in A-10 play). But its RPI and schedule numbers and lack of truly bad losses have it in position to lay claim to a bid if it can see this thing through. In a league full of confusion, there is something to be said for that.
