{"s":"The Knicks went 3-1 SU since my last power rankings update, however they are sticking in the third spot for now. My main reasoning for this is that I think the Knicks have referred back to some of their old ways. They fall in love with the three-point shot even when it's not falling, and in some games their defense has been severely lacking. Carmelo Anthony is only one man, and if New York's three-point arsenal isn't on, that puts a ton of pressure on him. The Knicks and Bulls could very well be interchangeable in the two and three spots on my power rankings, but New York’s recent lack of defensive intensity is somewhat concerning.
