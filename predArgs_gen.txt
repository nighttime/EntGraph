#line: That's how it's been going for the injury-plagued Avs, who have already been shut out three times this season. They were missing a chunk of their offense against Phoenix because captain Gabriel Landeskog missed a seventh straight game with a head injury and forward John Mitchell was sidelined with the flu. Steve Downie is out for the season with a torn ACL.

#line: Doan had the chance to net the winner thanks to his goalie. Mike Smith dominated Colorado last year when he posted a 3-0-0 record and a 1.33 goals-against average, and he was just as sharp early Monday night. He had 20 of his season-high 41 saves into the second period and made a couple of highlight stops to keep Colorado off the board.

The Avs worked hard keeping the puck in deep and Hejduk set up Olver in the high slot for a one-timer that looked like it defelcted up high off a Coyote stick and over Smith's shoulder. Score tied 1-1 off Olver's first of the year - and he earned it.

Too bad for Phoenix as the Avs handed them a long 5-on--3 and Sullivan was brought in this past offseason to beef up their PP. The Avs got some help from the post, but were able to get out of the second unscathed and nursing their 2-1 lead into the third.

#line: Some scary moments early in the third when Eric Johnson took a hit up high on his head/jaw from the giant Martin Hanzal . From the replay camera angle it looked like a solid hockey hit and Johnson was just caught turning into the blindsiding behemoth, but it sure looked like Johnson's head was the initial point of contact. Johnson stayed on the ice, but at the whistle skated straight to the bench and started beating the crap out of inanimate objects on his way to the locker room. He did not return. The news only got worse when a little later Antoine Vermette plowed through the slot and collided hard with Matt Duchene. Dutchy went off, later returned, but was obviously stinging.

#line: The Avalanche created a flurry in front of Smith with about 3 minutes left as the puck seemed to do everything but go in the back of the net. Yet another Avalanche player was hurt during the chaos as McLeod absorbed a gutless cross check in the side of his unprotected ribs. The Avs got a couple powerplays to end regulation that carried over to the Avs' first post-regulation game of the 2013 season. The overtime PP created a 4-on-3 advantage, but Mike Smith was able to fend off the onslaught, and then a stupid bounce off the refs skate turned what was a harmless puck over to Phoenix with numbers deep inside the Avs zone and Shane Doan netted the game winner. Unlucky bounce, but the Avs get a loser point. Unfortunate finish as the Avs outplayed Phoenix tonight. Hopefully the injuries sustained will turn out to be minor and we don't have to explore the organization's "depth" any more than we already are.

#line: The Avalanche came out with all kinds of jump, taking the play at Phoenix relentlessly for the first 5 minutes of the game, but an unlucky call against Sgarbossa for cross-checking (Vermette caught an edge making Sgarbossa's light little back pat look like a savage stampede of hate and evil) halted the Avs' forward momentum putting them down a man early. But the NHL's best home Penalty-Kill (yes, you read that right) killed off the penalty. In fact, the Coyotes didn't get their first shot on goal until after their power play, about 7 and 1/2 minutes in. But just as the Altidudes commented on how Phoenix had been shut out for almost 4 straight periods, Shane Doan snuck a quick back hander off a wrap around past Varlamov to put the visitors up 1-0. Not a good goal. Maybe it hit a skate or something? I hope....

Then, he helped end any hopes the Sharks had of a third-period comeback, assisting on a Nikita Nikitin goal 0:21 into the final frame. Dubsinky's 19:12 was also tops among Columbus forwards. Cody Goloubef scored his first NHL goal in the win.

#line: That was the Toronto Maple Leafs ' 5th and final goal in a 5-2 rout of the Philadelphia Flyers. Mark Fraser was on the ice for all five goals. The only downside was that they lost James Reimer to a lower-body injury, but Ben Scrivens was excellent in relief, making 32 saves... Mikko Koivu and Zach Parise scored in the shootout to give the Minnesota Wild a 2-1 win over the Calgary Flames... Jeff Carter puts the Kings on the board in the first period, then extended the lead to 2 in the second. That was all the Kings would need, but the Blues are really struggling to keep the puck out of their net these days, so LA scored twice more in a 4-1 win.

He once scored 56 goals in an NHL season and captured the "Rocket" Richard Trophy as the league's leading goal scorer (2005-06). He followed that up with another solid season (37 goals) in 2006-07 before seeing his goal-scoring touch slowly start to vanish. In 2008-09, he scored just 12 goals and was promptly traded to Ottawa, where he only scored five times in 2009-10 before the Senators bought out his contract.

For this reason, it’s important for people not to leave out trash and to scare (or "haze") coyotes who seem too comfortable around humans, he said.

In the Mass Audubon’s Habitat Wildlife Sancturary in Belmont one day, Maguranis was alarmed to hear barks from his left, right and rear, but discovered it was one coyote. These animals often "replicate" their barks, said Maguranis.

#line: Another way to look at it might be, Durant's Oklahoma City Thunder teammates lost him the crown. The Thunder uncharacteristically have traded wins and losses the past couple weeks. Durant certainly needs the Thunder to finish with a better record than the Heat if he wants to unseat three-time MVP James.

#line: 4. Saint Louis. For as many seeds of doubt as the Billikens planted (at least in my brain; your synaptic mileage may vary) in the first two weeks of A-10 play, after five consecutive victories it would appear that things are coming along just fine in Arch-land. (Ha, no one calls Saint Louis that.) After a home overtime loss to Rhode Island on Jan. 19, Jim Crews' squad demolished Butler and Dayton at home and handled business in three potentially tricky road games against RPI landmines. The most important trend? Defense. Saint Louis struggled in this regard for weeks, but it has since established itself as the stingiest per-possession defense in the Atlantic 10, and that should help the Billikens avoid setbacks on the road as they seek to bolster that NCAA tournament resume.

Because Charlotte, the 15th-best offense in the Atlantic 10, should never score 88 points on anyone, anywhere -- home, away, on Mars, anywhere. I know, I know: Temple got out of there with the W, which is what really matters. But 88 points in 74 possessions? Really? To Charlotte? Just another data point in a baffling Owls season, I guess.

#line: 7. Xavier. Without (god forbid) going into the whole eight-way tie thing again -- and again, you should not be freaking out about these ranks at this point -- this is where the validity of ranking any one A-10 outfit over the other starts to go a bit sideways. I like Xavier, and Chris Mack has done some nice things with a young team, particularly on the glass; the Musketeers out-board the rest of the league on both the offensive and defensive ends. But they don't appear likely to break out of this soft middle anytime soon.

#line: 1. Butler. Rhode Island remains a tough out more often than not in league play, and the Rams gave Butler a real go at Hinkle Fieldhouse on Saturday. But Butler held firm, winning 75-68, and followed that up with a more comfortable romp over St. Bonaventure on Wednesday night. Same deal remains with the Bulldogs: This is a good team, and one no one will want to play in March, but it still needs to get better on the defensive end to really justify its currently lofty ranking come tourney time.

The Rams haven't played their best basketball over the past month or so -- back-to-back losses to Richmond and La Salle made that clear enough -- primarily because their vaunted defense, one of the best and most entertaining in the country in November and December, has allowed 1.01 points per trip in A-10 play, seventh-fewest in the league. VCU's only game in the past week came at home against Fordham, which is a nice way to get your defense back on track. In sum: Saturday's trip to Charlotte should be very interesting.

#line: NOTES: The Nets will be without Williams for the final two games before the All-Star break because of inflammation in both of his ankles. Williams is averaging 16.7 points, 7.6 assists and 3.3 rebounds this season. C.J. Watson started at point guard against the Pacers. ... Pacers small forward Danny Granger (left knee) went through his first full-court contact practice Sunday. Coach Frank Vogel said Granger responded well after the practice. "He said he felt really good," Vogel said. "Couple of movements he felt like he was still getting his confidence back to explode. No pain or anything. Just normal recovering type of stuff in your first live action." Granger will make his season debut against Charlotte on Wednesday or the Pacers will hold him out until after the All-Star break so that he can make his debut against the New York Knicks on Feb. 20. ... West left the game in the first quarter after Lopez inadvertently scratched him in the left eye.

#line: The times they are changing, and the NBA’s Eastern Conference is turning over and changing with the times. Teams from the bottom half have moved solidly into the top three, and although they continue to win, the Miami Heat do not have the cushion they had in the first half of the season. There seem to be more than just one or two teams emerging that could give the Heat a run season, so let's look at the updated East standings and see if I have the teams similarly ranked.

#line: The Heat had an up-and-down last week, but they still sit atop the East with a 1 1/2 game cushion. Over the last week, the Heat have played in two overtime games, winning one and losing the other. Last night they had a huge win against the Brooklyn Nets, which most of us saw coming after the ignorant comments of Reggie Evans. However, even though they continue to win their lead in the Eastern conference is shrinking fast. With the exception of a trip to Indiana they don't have that many tough games within the next week, however right before and right after the All-Star break Miami has a stretch of about six very tough games in a row. They could be fade material coming soon.

#line: Despite their ugly loss last night to Miami, the Nets hold down the fourth spot on my power rankings once again this week. Brooklyn has been playing very well since Avery Johnson fired, and I do not know if there is correlation in that or if it is just coincidence, but the fact remains that Brooklyn has finally emerged as one of the East’s best teams. Deron Williams is finally starting to look like himself once again, and that always leads to getting easier shots for the rest of Brooklyn's starters. They need to prove (much like the Knicks, Bulls and Heat have done already this season) that they can beat the NBA's best teams. If and/or when they do it, watch out and be ready with your NBA betting tickets.

#line: The Knicks went 3-1 SU since my last power rankings update, however they are sticking in the third spot for now. My main reasoning for this is that I think the Knicks have referred back to some of their old ways. They fall in love with the three-point shot even when it's not falling, and in some games their defense has been severely lacking. Carmelo Anthony is only one man, and if New York's three-point arsenal isn't on, that puts a ton of pressure on him. The Knicks and Bulls could very well be interchangeable in the two and three spots on my power rankings, but New York’s recent lack of defensive intensity is somewhat concerning. I think the Knicks might be fade material right now in certain cases.

#line: The Bulls are currently ranked 2nd in the Eastern Central Conference, coming in right behind the Indiana Pacers. Chicago currently hold the overall no 11 spot (out of 30 teams) with 20 wins and 20 losses. As Stein points out, "It's getting harder and harder to resist projecting what the Bulls will look like when Derrick Rose comes back. One big reason for that: Chicago already has the best intraconference record in the East at a tidy 23-9. Which goes rather nicely with the East's best road record (15-9)."

#line: Chicago ascended to the two spot in my power rankings last week, and it is looking more and more like they are in fact the second best team in the Eastern conference. The emergence of Jimmy Butler for this team has been like making a big trade without having to give anything up. Not to mention the fact that Derrick Rose just started taking full contact in practice. Even though Rose's return will be slow and likely off the bench, 20 minutes of Derrick Rose is still better than three out of every four NBA players. The Bulls have two, and arguably three All-Stars this year, and once all the pieces of the puzzle are in place, and if Rose is healthy towards the end of the regular season, watch out Lebron. I think Chicago might start evening out that awful ATS record of theirs soon and begin to beat the NBA odds . They started last night.

#line: 6. Massachusetts. I suppose you could say I'm coming around on UMass. Or you could say I'm very rapidly transitioning from my role as someone who allows tempo-free statistics to aid much of my fickle eyeballs' analysis into someone who must acknowledge the cold realpolitik of NCAA tournament qualification. (It is kind of what I do around here .) Either way, the fact of the matter is that for as utterly mediocre as UMass' per-possessions numbers tell me the Minutemen are, and for as rarely as I've been impressed when I've watched them this season, their at-large profile is such that they have a pretty good chance of getting into the NCAA tournament. It's pretty strange: This is a team that isn't truly bad at anything (save 3-point shooting) but excels at nothing (save perhaps field-goal defense, and UMass has gotten more more and more stops in A-10 play). But its RPI and schedule numbers and lack of truly bad losses have it in position to lay claim to a bid if it can see this thing through. In a league full of confusion, there is something to be said for that.

#line: The Oklahoma City Thunder attempt to become the second NBA team to reach 40 wins this season when they visit the Utah Jazz on Tuesday. San Antonio has won a league-best 41 games and Oklahoma City is battling the Spurs for the top seed in the Western Conference. The Thunder have won four consecutive games as they face a Utah squad that has lost two straight contests after losing to the Sacramento Kings on Saturday.The Jazz are currently seventh in the Western Conference playoff race. Utah has lost back-to-back games with the first of those being a rare home loss. The Jazz fell to the Chicago Bulls on Friday to drop to 19-6 at home. Oklahoma City clobbered the Phoenix Suns twice by a combined 59 points and Sunday's 97-69 victory marked just the third time in 14 games that the Thunder didn't reach 100 points. Oklahoma City is 16-9 on the road.TV: 9 p.m. ET, Fox Sports Oklahoma, ROOT (Utah)ABOUT THE THUNDER (39-12): Oklahoma City has won each game by more than 20 points during the current winning streak, with the average victory being 25.3 points. The Thunder have allowed an average of 88.5 points during the stretch as the defensive performance has been as impressive as the typically solid offense. "Defense first," All-Star forward Kevin Durant said. "These last two or three games have been great for us on the defensive end, setting the tone. We have to keep it up." Guard Russell Westbrook had 23 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists and seven steals when the Thunder beat the Jazz 106-94 on Nov. 30.ABOUT THE JAZZ (28-24): Utah certainly wants to avoid a third straight loss with the All-Star break looming. The Jazz played poorly while losing at lowly Sacramento and feel the urgency with the Thunder looming, followed by a road game at Minnesota. "We just dropped two in a row," forward Paul Millsap said. "These next two games are important for us coming into the break. It will give us a little momentum going into the break, especially after we dropped these last two." Reserve guard Alec Burks had a career-best 24 points in the loss against the Kings.BUZZER BEATERS 1. Oklahoma City has won six of the last seven meetings with Utah. 2. Jazz swingman Gordon Hayward (shoulder) will likely miss his ninth straight outing.3. The status of Thunder G Kevin Martin (flu) will be decided in the hours before the game.PREDICTION: Thunder 102, Jazz 97.
